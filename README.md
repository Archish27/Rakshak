# Rakshak
The app, Rakshak, was designed by keeping in mind, the current disaster management techniques already in place as suggested by the Government. The major feature is the real-time updates coupled with a fast volunteer dispatch system, which will help the organisation/Government to quickly dispatch volunteers to specific disaster affected areas, within a few seconds of the occurrence of the incident.

Once the volunteers are dispatched to the specific incident, they can then give timely updates about the incident through their device, information like a missing person report, causality reports, regions affected, etc.

This information will be sent as notifications to all the users who have subscribed to get updates for the incident, like a news channel app, which is user customizable.

It also contains information about different NGOs, emergency contact numbers, etc. which will help the user in critical times.

This app, once implemented by an organisation or the Government, will help in responding quickly to any type of incident, thus saving lives and helping people.
